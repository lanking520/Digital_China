## System Structure
### Database
Today's talking with Xin Hu, the system structure was based a single database with different access. 
Similar to the domain method in the Embedded System, all information would be stored into the single database and
access differently between companies. It could possibly help the system reduce the size of the storage however incease
the instability of the system cruption. Once the database was done, it means all companies service was done.
### Service
The running mode of the iQuicker was service for companies less than 100 person. The functionalities of the management 
software was not complete. In this case, there is a need to add more functions to the company in order to serve the large
company. By using the public cloud service, our own foundamental database and some server, we just provide the access of our software.
Comparing to the previous company management system, there is no need to secure the Server or manage the software system. The users in 
the company will receive the live update of the software. It's also possbile to run the entire system on a large company with their own
server.
